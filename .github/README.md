## Contentment for Umbraco

> contentment /kənˈtɛntm(ə)nt/ - a state of happiness and satisfaction

### What is it?

This is a collection of Umbraco components that I have developed for use on my own **Umbraco 8** implementation projects.

Some components may be innovative, others may be a reimagining of existing components, property-editors, features and other community packages.


#### Why should I use it?

I'm sharing my code with the world. It is your choice (and responsibility) whether you would like to use it.
No pressure or marketing spin from me.


#### What's on offer?

Let's take a look inside...

##### Property Editors

- [Bytes](../docs/editors/bytes.md) - a read-only label to display file sizes in relative bytes.
- [Code Editor](../docs/editors/code-editor.md) - a code snippet editor, _(using the ACE library that is bundled with Umbraco)._
- [Content Blocks](../docs/editors/content-blocks.md) - a block editor, configurable using element types.
- [Data List](../docs/editors/data-list.md) - an editor that combines a custom data source with a custom list editor.
- [Icon Picker](../docs/editors/icon-picker.md) - an editor to select an icon (from the Umbraco icon library).
- [Notes](../docs/editors/notes.md) - a read-only label to display rich-text instructional messages for content editors.
- [Number Input](../docs/editors/number-input.md) - a numeric editor, with sizing configurations.
- [Render Macro](../docs/editors/render-macro.md) - a read-only label dynamically generated from an Umbraco Macro.
- [Text Input](../docs/editors/text-input.md) - a textstring editor, configurable with HTML5 options.

#### Telemetry

Information about the [telemetry feature](../docs/telemetry.md).

#### Releases

Downloads are available on the [releases page](https://github.com/leekelleher/umbraco-contentment/releases).

#### Installation

> *Note:* Contentment v2.x has been developed against **Umbraco v8.13.0** and will support that version and above.
> If you are using **Umbraco v8.6.1 (or above)**, you can continue to use Contentment v1.x.

Contentment can be installed from either Our Umbraco or NuGet package repositories, or build manually from the source-code:

##### Our Umbraco package repository

To install from Our Umbraco, please download the package from:

> <https://our.umbraco.com/packages/backoffice-extensions/contentment/>

##### NuGet package repository

To [install from NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Our.Umbraco.Community.Contentment), you can run the following command from within Visual Studio:

    PM> Install-Package Our.Umbraco.Community.Contentment

#### Known issues

- **Data List**
  - When using the Umbraco Content data source with an XPath query, inside a Nested Content editor, it will not be able to identify the contextual containing node ID. e.g. your XPath query will not work. [See #30 for details.](https://github.com/leekelleher/umbraco-contentment/issues/30)


### Documentation

[Documentation for each of the components - with screenshots, use-cases and code examples - can be found in the /docs folder](../docs/).

Please note, you may find other components within Contentment that have not yet been documented.<br>
_Let's call those "life's little surprises"._


### Roadmap

If you would like to know what is coming up in future releases, then take a look at the [roadmap](ROADMAP.md).


### Support

I've been doing open source for a long time. I have suffered my fair share of burnout and empathy fatigue.

I reserve the right to address bug reports or feature requests in my own time, or ignore them completely.

**Any feedback is welcome and appreciated.** But please keep in mind, I am not your personal support developer.

If you are really stuck, do remember that the Umbraco community is amongst the friendliest on our planet, learn to embrace it. 
Ask for help on the [Our Umbraco support forum](https://our.umbraco.com/), I am sure someone can help you there.
