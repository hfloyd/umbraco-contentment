# Umbraco Contentment - Roadmap

Here is a _provisional_ roadmap for the Contentment for Umbraco package, to be actioned at my own pleasure.


## v1

### v1.0

Initial release.

Compiles against Umbraco CMS v8.6.1, _(this was the latest version at the time of initial release)._

Property Editors are:

- [Bytes](../docs/editors/bytes.md)
- [Data List](../docs/editors/data-list.md)
- [Icon Picker](../docs/editors/icon-picker.md)
- [Notes](../docs/editors/notes.md)
- [Render Macro](../docs/editors/render-macro.md)

### v1.1

- [Content Blocks](../docs/editors/content-blocks.md)
- Data List: Umbraco Content _(a data source for selecting nodes)_

### v1.2

- [Text Input](../docs/editors/text-input.md) _(a reimagining of the textstring editor)_
- [Number Input](../docs/editors/number-input.md) _(a reimagining of the numeric editor)_
- Data List: Templated List _(use custom AngularJS markup to render items)_
- Telemetry

### v1.3

- [Code Editor](../docs/editors/code-editor.md) _(using ACE bundled with Umbraco)_
- Data List: Preview _(a real time preview of the configured Data Source and List Editor)_
- Data List: Buttons _(list editor, similar to what folk see used in Umbraco Uno)_
- Data List: Tags _(list editor, visually similar to Umbraco Tags editor)_

### v1.4

- _A bunch of (hidden) extra data-sources._ 🤫


## v2

### v2.0

- _(At the time of writing),_ a breaking-change release _(following SemVer guidelines),_ of v1.4.x features that will compile against Umbraco CMS v8.14.


## v3

### v3.0

- _Under active development!_ [See my developer's journal for the latest updates.](https://github.com/leekelleher/umbraco-contentment/discussions/105) A breaking-change release _(following SemVer guidelines),_ of v2.x features that will compile against Umbraco CMS v9.0.0.


## Future feature releases

_Who knows?!_ `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`

**There are [plenty of ideas](IDEAS.md)!**
